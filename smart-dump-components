should be smart
  course-admin OK
  main-admin OK
  dialog-create-course OK
  dialog-create-student OK

should be dump
  app OK
  overlay OK
  tile OK
  tile-gallery OK
  lessons-table WILL BE OK
  courses
  students-table

components we use services
  course-admin
  courses
  students-table

should be refactored
  course-admin - should create course-form component
  students-table - should rename to students-section; addCourse students-table component
  make a dialog component reusable - in order to do this I need:
  get data:
    1. title
    2. array of {formControlName, placeholder}
    3. action name


in order to make reusable components we should ask a question:
should this component know about anything? e.g.: some logic, data flow and events
if not, we should make this component dumb and move this logic into a smart one
